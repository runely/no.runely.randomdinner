Have some fun with your kids by creating some random dinners.
Combine this with a text-to-speech app and let everyone have some fun :)

Don't expect to get a dinner that you can cook or eat. This is purely for fun ;)

Add your own words

- Open settings (configure app)
  - Scroll down to 'Custom words'
  - Fill in the words in the sections you want

Usage

- Create a flow
  - Add the action card 'Create random dinner' and adjust it to your liking
  - Add an action card to show or speak the created random dinner by using the tag 'Random dinner'
    - Add a 1-second delay to the action card to allow the first action card to finish
